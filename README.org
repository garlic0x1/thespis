Thespis is a threaded actor library for Common Lisp.

* TODO Installation

With [[https://ultralisp.org][Ultralisp]] installed:

#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :thespis)
#+end_src

* Counter Example

#+begin_src lisp
;;            name    state   args
(define-actor counter ((i 0)) (increment)
  (sleep 1)
  (incf i increment))

(let ((actor (counter))) ; spawn a counter actor
  (send actor 2)         ; returns instantly
  (ask actor 1)          ; returns 3 after 2 seconds
  (close-actor actor))   ; cleanup
#+end_src

In this example, we define a prototype of a counter actor, this
defines a function of the same name that will spawn an instance of
this actor and lets us define slots for it to store state in, and
arguments for messages sent to the actor.

If you try this in your REPL you will notice that `send` is
asynchronous, it enqueues a message for the actor and returns
instantly.  The `ask` function is synchronous and waits for its
message to be processed and returns the result of the actor's
processing.

* TODO Pong Example

Here is a little pong example, I might add a more convenient way to
communicate with singleton actors:

#+begin_src lisp
(defun pong ()
  (let (*pinger* *ponger*)
    (define-actor pinger () (c)
      (format t "~a: ping!~%" c)
      (force-output)
      (sleep 0.2)
      (if (< c 10)
          (send *ponger* (1+ c))
          (progn (close-actor *ponger*)
                 (close-actor *pinger*))))

    (define-actor ponger () (c)
      (format t "~a: pong!~%" c)
      (force-output)
      (sleep 0.2)
      (if (< c 10)
          (send *pinger* (1+ c))
          (progn (close-actor *ponger*)
                 (close-actor *pinger*))))

    (setf *ponger* (ponger) *pinger* (pinger))
    (send *ponger* 0)
    (join-actor *ponger*)
    (join-actor *pinger*)))
#+end_src
